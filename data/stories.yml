# Rejected stories

# Ok this created an interesting thing -> if I did a repeat, i.e. one of my inputs wasn't recognised, then the deny at the end would 
# lead to confirm further help but not utter end of simulation. Two paths: either make a rule with "utter_purchase_interest" "deny" OR 
# Combine confirm_further_help and end_of_simulation so they are a single reply
