### is_first_class slot which will be a bool kind of like the tracked slot, and a size slot which will be a categorical slot

responses:
  utter_greet:

  utter_opening_times:
  - text: "Opening times vary between branches. Typical opening times for post office are as follows: \n\nMonday: 09:00 - 17:30
      Tuesday: 09:00 - 17:30 \n

  utter_avg_delivery_times:
  - text: "Delivery times depend on the postage class you purchase for your parcel. \n\nParcels sent through 1st Class Postage should arrive at their destination within 1 to 2 business days. \n\nParcels sent through 2nd Class Postage should arrive within 3 to 5 business days. \n\nDue to unforseen circumstances, there might be a 1-2 day delay."

  utter_parcel_box:

  # ### Remember, the formula is: utter_ask_<form_name>_<slot_name>
  utter_ask_postage_form_postage_size:
  - text: "Three size categories are available, determined by the box's dimensions: \n\nSmall: 45x35x16cm, <2kg\nMedium: 61x46x46cm, 2-5kg\nLarge: 100x100x100cm, >5kg \n\nParcel belongs to a category if its dimensions don’t exceed any of the above-mentioned measurements. Which category fits your parcel?"

  utter_ask_postage_form_first_class:
  - text: "It is recommended to send the parcel using 1st class postage, meaning your parcel will arrive within 1-2 business days. \n\nThe only alternative is 2nd class postage, which will take between 3 to 5 business days to deliver. \n\nHere is the pricing for both classes:
      \n\n1st Class Postage: \n
      Small: £4.85 \n
      Medium: £5.60 \n
      Large: £7.20 \n\n2nd Class Postage: \n
      Small: £3.25 \n
      Medium: £4.85 \n
      Large: £6.50 \n\nIs 1st Class Postage suitable? If not, the following interactions will proceed under the assumption that 2nd Class Postage has been chosen."

  utter_purchase_interest:
  - text: "It is possible for you to purchase the postage label now. You will be walked through the purchase process step by step. Sending a message ‘stop’ at any point will stop the process and delete the process' progress. If you make a mistake at any point, wait until the summary is displayed and say ‘no’ when asked if the information is correct. \n\nContinue?"

### So these actions will need to be replaced by the proper actions for this half of the chatbots
### Though funnily enough, the names might be the same so I might just uncomment this - the two actions required are still smth to do with postage form validation
### and calculation of postage costs
actions:
- action_calculate_postage_low

### Currently commented out but will probably be fairly similar, the only main thing that will change is the required slots in the postage_form
forms:
  postage_form:
    ignored_intents:
    - stop
    required_slots:
      - postage_size
      - first_class

  address_form:
    ignored_intents:
    - stop
    - break
    required_slots:
      - reciever_address
      - sender_address

session_config:
  session_expiration_time: 60
  carry_over_slots_to_new_session: true
